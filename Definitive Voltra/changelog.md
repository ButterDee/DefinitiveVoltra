## Definitive Voltra v0.4.2

- Small patch that removes "The Sonic Virus" from part of The Final Horizon's opening.
- For context; During the live stream for the beta of the Supercharged Update, Voltra suddenly turned into Sonic, because of the model being stored inside of the cutscene.
- This has been dubbed "The Sonic Virus" by hweilla.

- Make sure to load this mod above Realtime Cutscenes Definitive Edition, or The Sonic Virus will return!
